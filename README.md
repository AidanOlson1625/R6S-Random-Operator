# R6S-Random-Operator
A MATLAB function that picks n unique, random rainbow six siege operators from the defenders or attackers side.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first person shooter where attackers face defenders in close quarters combat to complete objectives like secure an area, diffuse a bomb, or rescue a hostage. Each side has a unique list of 30 some operaters (and growing!) that have specific functions and gagets. One day, I got indecisive and lazy and decided to create a random number generator that picked an operator for me so I wouldn't have to decide.

The operators on this MATLAB file were last updated on October 3rd 2023 with the addition of Ram, an attacking operator. Change the `side` input to select either attackers or deffenders, and change `n` for the amount of unique operators to be randomly selected. Multiple functions can be called to select operators for a custom game matchup or tournament.
