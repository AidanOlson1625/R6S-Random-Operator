# R6S-Random-Operator
A MATLAB function that picks n unique, random rainbow six siege operators from the defenders or attackers side.

I got indecisive and lazy one day playing Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and decided to create a random number generator that picked an operator for me so I wouldn't have to decide. 

The operators on this MATLAB file were last updated on October 3rd 2023 with the addition of Ram, an attacking operator. Change the `side` input to select either attackers or deffenders, and change `n` for the amount of unique operators to be randomly picked. Multiple functions can be called to select operators for a custom game matchup or tournament.
